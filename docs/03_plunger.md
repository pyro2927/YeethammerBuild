## Steps

After that is complete, slide the plastic tube over the plunger cap, securing it with super glue.

Push two `nut-clips` into `body-pt-guide-fore`, and then slide both `body-pt-guide-fore` and `body-pt-guide-aft` onto the body rails, making sure that `thumbhole-stock` and `grip-cover` are in place, as they will not be able to be added once the screws are in place. Once that is all lined up (photo below), use a 30mm bolt/nut to secure `body-pt-guide-aft` to the rails and keep everything in place.
